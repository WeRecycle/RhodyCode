      <h4>This humble site has its roots grounded in a computer science project developed by six undergraduate students who wanted to bring
      together the URI community and share their love of programming. The goal of this platform is to provide a common space where like-minded
      URI students and faculty can collaborate on various programming projects and explore their interests together. The RhodyCode platform
      allows users to sign up with their URI email address and create projects that can be viewed and joined by other members. Users have
      the opportunity to tell each other about themselves through a customizable profile page, and can express their interests and proficiencies
      for others to see.

      <center><h4>Have an idea for a project but not sure how to start? Not a problem! Using the easy-to-understand project creation page is very
      straightforward. Simply create a new project and fill out as much information as you are able. Projects can range from something as
      general as an idea for a new game to a business application already in development. Other users will be able to join the project and
      combine their own expertise with yours, paving the way for a collaborative partnership and successful project development.

      Want to find out what projects are available? Sign in and browse the project listings at your leisure. Our up-to-date project page
       ensures that the most recently added and updated projects will be the first things you find. If you want to look for something more
       specific, choose one or many different tags related to the types of projects you wish to see and the RhodyCode platform will do its
       best to match your needs.
